# KeyBind TUI Application

## Overview

This is a Text User Interface (TUI) application that allows users to manage keybindings and categories. The application enables users to add new keybindings, categorize them, and navigate through them in a structured manner. The TUI interface uses `textual` to build interactive and easy-to-navigate screens.

## Features

- **Add Keybinds**: Users can add new keybindings by specifying the keys, description, and category.
- **Category Management**: Users can select a category to filter keybindings by category.
- **Scrollable Grid**: A scrollable table is available to display the keybindings, making navigation seamless.
- **Keybinding Display**: The keybindings are displayed with their associated keys and descriptions.
- **SQLite Database**: Uses SQLite as the database to store and retrieve keybindings and categories.
- **Quit Dialog**: The application provides a quit dialog to confirm whether users want to exit the application.
